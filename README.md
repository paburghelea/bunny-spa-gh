## Grasshopper Bunny Shortest Path (Example)

In this activity, you'll tackle a fun and challenging problem using Computer Science algorithms. The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem, where the goal is to find the most efficient route that visits a set of locations exactly once and returns to the starting point.

In this Easter-themed version of the problem, you are an Easter Bunny traveling between various locations to deliver Easter eggs to different parts of the forest animals. Your task is to figure out the shortest path that allows the bunny to visit every location (each with its own basket of eggs) and return home to the Easter Bunny's den.

# Egg Hunt in the Rhino Realm

In a lush spring meadow within the Rhino workspace, a bunny embarks on an Easter egg hunt. The bunny needs to collect 5 brightly colored eggs scattered across the field. The challenge? He is in rush! Find the shortest path to collect all the eggs and return to the starting point — without retracing its steps.

The bunny can now celebrate its successful egg hunt, having gathered all the eggs with the shortest hop path possible! The script uses a series of optimizations to help the bunny avoid any unnecessary detours, leaving plenty of time for a celebratory carrot snack.

[The travelling salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) or TSP, is a common problem in computer science, which aims to find the optimal route to be travelled between a series of cities, while not visiting the same city twice.

This problem is part of a larger set of problems wich have a resolution using graphs (graph problems).

Grasshopper is the key component that integrates everything, enabling us to combine multiple separate coding elements into a cohesive system. The repository includes two distinct solutions: one featuring a code input optimization and the other utilizing Anemone.

For beginners, I recommend starting with the Anemone definition, as it simplifies understanding loops and state management. Once you’re comfortable with that, you can begin exploring the C# definition for more advanced functionality.
