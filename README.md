Grasshopper Bunny Shortest Path (Example)

Egg Hunt in the Rhino Realm

In a lush spring meadow within the Rhino workspace, a playful bunny embarks on an Easter egg hunt. The bunny needs to collect 5 brightly colored eggs scattered across the field. The challenge? He is in rush! Find the shortest path to collect all the eggs and return to the starting point â€” without retracing its steps.

The bunny can now celebrate its successful egg hunt, having gathered all the eggs with the shortest hop path possible! Our optimization helped the bunny avoid any unnecessary detours, leaving plenty of time for a celebratory carrot snack.
