# Egg Hunt in the Rhino Realm

In a lush spring meadow within the Rhino workspace, a bunny embarks on an Easter egg hunt. The bunny needs to collect 5 brightly colored eggs scattered across the field. The challenge? He is in rush! Find the shortest path to collect all the eggs and return to the starting point — without retracing its steps.

The bunny can now celebrate its successful egg hunt, having gathered all the eggs with the shortest hop path possible! The script uses a series of optimizations to help the bunny avoid any unnecessary detours, leaving plenty of time for a celebratory carrot snack.


# Similar problem
[The travelling salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) or TSP, is a common problem in computer science, which aims to find the optimal route to be travelled between a series of cities, while not visiting the same city twice. 

This problem is part of a larger set of problems wich have a resolution using graphs (graph problems).
